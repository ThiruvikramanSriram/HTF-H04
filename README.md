## Backend Model

## Overview

The goal of this project is to forecast healthcare demand using real-time SDoH data. The ideal model combination should:

- Handle seasonality and trends.
- Capture non-linear relationships between socio-economic factors and healthcare demand.
- Integrate temporal dependencies to account for both short-term and long-term changes.
- Provide interpretable results, especially when dealing with sensitive healthcare data.

## Model Combination

### 1. Primary Model: SARIMA + XGBoost

#### SARIMA (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average)
- **Purpose**: Captures seasonality and trends in healthcare demand data.
- **Strengths**:
  - Excellent for short-term forecasting.
  - Handles strong seasonal components (e.g., flu season spikes in hospital admissions).
  - Provides a baseline prediction for healthcare demand.

#### XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)
- **Purpose**: Models non-linear relationships between socio-economic variables (SDoH) and healthcare demand.
- **Strengths**:
  - Handles complex interactions and feature importance.
  - Adjusts the baseline forecast provided by SARIMA by considering socio-economic and external factors like unemployment and eviction rates.

### 2. Add-on Models for Enhancement

#### LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
- **Purpose**: Captures long-term dependencies in time-series data.
- **Strengths**:
  - Useful for complex temporal relationships (e.g., effects of economic downturns on demand over several months).
  - Learns from historical data and socio-economic indicators over time.

#### Random Forests
- **Purpose**: Improves upon decision trees by averaging over multiple trees to reduce overfitting.
- **Strengths**:
  - Performs well with a mix of categorical and continuous data.
  - Models complex interactions in socio-economic factors influencing healthcare demand.

#### NARNET (Nonlinear Autoregressive Neural Network)
- **Purpose**: Specifically designed for forecasting time-series data with non-linear dependencies.
- **Strengths**:
  - Captures non-linear dependencies in both historical demand and external factors (SDoH).
  - Good alternative to SARIMA for non-linear trends.

#### Vector Autoregression (VAR)
- **Purpose**: Models multiple interdependent time-series data.
- **Strengths**:
  - Captures relationships between multiple healthcare indicators or socio-economic variables affecting healthcare demand.
  - Useful for forecasting based on past values of all related variables.

## Evaluation Metrics

To evaluate the performance of these models, the following metrics are used:

### For SARIMA/XGBoost (and Random Forests, if used):
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Measures the average magnitude of errors.
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: Penalizes larger errors more than MAE.
- **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**: Good for percentage-based errors in forecasting.
- **R-squared**: Measures how well the model explains the variance in the data.

### For LSTM and NARNET:
- **RMSE**: Evaluates the accuracy of the model‚Äôs predictions.
- **Precision, Recall, and F1-score**: Useful for classification tasks like identifying at-risk communities.

### For VAR:
- **AIC (Akaike Information Criterion)** and **BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion)**: For model selection and comparing different models based on their complexity.
